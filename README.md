# Submission and Uploads remover for WS Form Pro
This small plugin enables you to remove old submission entries and uploaded files created by WS Form Pro. A daily run cronjob will check for entries that are older than the configured time. A Dry-Mode and Log-File is available as well. Additionally, any empty directories in the uploads folder will be deleted. This plugin was developed with Wordpress Version 6.8.1 and WS Form Pro Version 1.10.51.

Be aware that files and entries are deleted forever AND CAN NOT BE RESTORED. Use at your own risk.
